# RISC-V-Processor

RISC-V is a standard Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) which is used to established Reduced Instruction Set Architecture(RISC-V) based on 32-bit, complete datapath present in the RISCV.circ file. Each circuit file holds an individual operational block. The datapath works for R, I, S, B, auiPC, lui, lw, JAL and JALR instructions. Different blocks used for immegiate generation, ALU, branch ALU, register file, controller, decoder, etc. Operand A and B are used to represent two main inputs. 7 bit Opcode used which define the type of instructions whiich can be decoded completely to execute an operation. Program counter would calculate the next address. A constant 4 is used in the program counter for memory allocation. ROM and RAM used for memory. ROM can clear and load different codes for testing.
